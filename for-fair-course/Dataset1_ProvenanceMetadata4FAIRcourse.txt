Explanation

Example provenance metadata file for Dataset 1, introduced during the EMBRC FAIR data course in 2025.
Dataset 1 consists of the logsheets in which data related to and collected during a 
 sampling event are recorded.
This example uses an EMBRC provenance model to describe the activities and material that 
 lead to Dataset 1. This file can then be used to provide the provenance metadata for the
 logsheets, for any material samples that still exist (e.g. replicates), and for any data 
 or scientific results that are derived from that material and from the logsheets.  

To make this file more compact and easier to read, we will first list the metadata for entities 
 that occurr more than once or which have to be described with more than one value. We will 
 then refer to them by their name or identifier when the activities are described.
