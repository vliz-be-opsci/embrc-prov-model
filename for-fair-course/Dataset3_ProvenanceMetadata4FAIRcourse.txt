Explanation

Example provenance metadata file for Dataset 3, introduced during the EMBRC FAIR data course in 2025
Dataset 3 consists of a spreadsheet of plankton species names and numbers, produced by 
 the FlowCam from the water sample.  It also includes a software settings file.
This example uses an EMBRC provenance model to describe the activities and material that 
 lead to Dataset 3. This file can then be used to provide the provenance metadata for the
 species identifications, and for any data or scientific results that are derived from those.  

To make this file more compact and easier to read, we will first list the metadata for entities 
 that occurr more than once or which have to be described with more than one value. We will 
 then refer to them by their name or identifier when the activities are described.

## Software
name: VisualSpreadsheet FlowCam Micro software
description: the software that comes with this FlowCam, bought in 2010
settings: file flowcam-settings.txt which comes with this dataset

## Protocol
name: classification QC
description: Manual filtering of the flowcam outputs, to remove misidentifications. Method steps: (1) visual inspection of the classified images by a first plankton expert, who suggested reclassifications or removal of the images from the dataset (2) visual inspection and confirmation/rejection of suggestions by a second export (3) reclassification in the image metadata and the spreadsheet for those that both experts agreed on, and agreed rejected results removed from the dataset.
