# Documentation

This folder provides materials to support the understanding of the model.

### Content

- **ProvenanceOfBiologicalMaterial_main.pdf**: the first document you should read, explaining the background, scope, concept of the model, and the various classes and properties of the model; with fully-worked out examples of the implementation of the model (which have associated files in the [examples repo](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/tree/main/examples)
- **ProvenanceOfBiologicalMaterial_technical.pdf**: the technical details of the classes and properties of the model, and the RDF and EML (to come) implementations, can be found in this technical document 
- **FAIR Data Management: Provenance and the Nagoya Protocol**: an explanation of the Nagoya Protocol, ABS permits, and how this all relates to provenance of biological material
- **./diagrams**: visualisations of the model that illustrate the structure and concepts can be found here

Note to self: the gdoc versions of the ProvOfBioMat_main/technical.pdf files are on my gfolder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1_-i1Jv8jcVO00QCQ3GfNefKh1yw7pQHJ) (called first release vs the running version which are the living documents)
