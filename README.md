- **[./docs](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/tree/main/docs)**  
provides detailed explanations of the agnostic provenance model.  
- **[./examples](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/tree/main/examples)**  
demonstrates how the provenance model can be applied, based on 4 example datasets.
- **[./implementations](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/tree/main/implementations)**  
implmentations of the agnostic provenenance model following various syntaxes.
