Explanation

Example provenance metadata file for Dataset 4, which is described in XXXXX 
  Please see that document to understand the context of these metadata
Dataset 4 consists of the 18S sequences produced by a sequencing centre from the sample collected 
in Dataset 1.
This example uses the EMBRC provenance model to describe the activities and material that 
 lead to Dataset 4. This file can then be used to provide the provenance metadata for the
 logsheets, for any material samples that still exist (e.g. replicates), and for any data 
 or scientific results that are derived from that material and from the logsheets.  
This file is one of three examples we provide for Dataset 4: this is a plain text version, 
 written for humans rather than machines to read; a version in Turtle, which is written for
 machines; and a version using the EML metadata schema, which biodiversity databases use. 

To make this file more compact and easier to read, we will first list the metadata for entities 
 that occurr more than once or which have to be described with more than one value. We will 
 then refer to them by their name or identifier when the activities are described.

Note that in the outputs the Optional sequencing summary metrics have been set to include the “percentage of PhiX”, the “percentage of aligned reads” - the percent of reads that are aligned to PhiX should be close to the percent of PhiX spiked in, the “percentage of clusters passing the filter” and the “cluster density”.


## The provenance metadata for the final data processing activity (Step 7)
<DataProcessing>
activity-type: Illumina filter
name: Illumina filtering 
description: QC: filtering of raw data to remove unwanted clusters and produce the final 18s sequences
spatial-coverage: 2021-10-12
agent: see DNA technician
input: Raw digital sequences SequencingIsUs_BigProject001_c_data. Data available upon request to BigProject (in folder BigProject_2021/fromSequencer) 
output: Filtered digital sequences produced by the filtering step. Data available upon request to BigProject (in folder BigProject_2021/QC/fromIllumina)
protocol:
  name: Illumina filtering with proprietary software
  description: Filtering of raw data to remove clusters that have "too much" intensity corresponding to bases other than the call-base. By default, the purity of the signal from each cluster is examined over the first 25 cycles and calculated as Chastity = Highest_Intensity / (Highest_Intensity + Next_Highest_Intensity) for each cycle. The default filtering implemented at the base calling stage allows at most one cycle that is less than the Chastity threshold (0,6).
