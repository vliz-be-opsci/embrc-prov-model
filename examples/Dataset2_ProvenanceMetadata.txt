Explanation

Example provenance metadata file for Dataset 2, which is described in the document 
  https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/blob/main/docs/ProvenanceOfBiologicalMaterial_4paper.pdf
  This example uses the conceptual model (CM) of provenance presented there. 
  Please see that document to understand the context of these metadata.
Dataset 2 consists of the outputs of the FlowCam: images and a file of species identifications.  
  It also includes a protocol document and a software settings file.
This file is one of three examples we provide for Dataset 2: this is a plain text version, 
 written for humans rather than machines to read; a version in Turtle, which is written for
 machines, and a version using the EML metadata schema, which biodiversity databases use. 

To make this file more compact and easier to read, we will first list the metadata for entities 
 that occurr more than once or which have to be described with more than one value. We will 
 then refer to them by their name or identifier when the activities are described.

name: classification QC
description: Manual filtering of the flowcam outputs, to remove misidentifications. Method steps: (1) visual inspection of the classified images by a first plankton expert, who suggested reclassifications or removal of the images from the dataset (2) visual inspection and confirmation/rejection of suggestions by a second export (3) reclassification in the image metadata and the spreadsheet for those that both experts agreed on, and agreed rejected results removed from the dataset.
