Explanation

Example provenance metadata file for Dataset 2, which is described in XXXXX 
  Please see that document to understand the context of these metadata
Dataset 2 consists of the images produced by the FlowCam from the water sample.  
This example uses the EMBRC provenance model to describe the activities and material that 
 lead to Dataset 2. This file can then be used to provide the provenance metadata for the
 images, and for any data or scientific results that are derived from those images.  
This file is one of three examples we provide for Dataset 2: this is a plain text version, 
 written for humans rather than machines to read; a version in Turtle, which is written for
 machines, and a version using the EML metadata schema, which biodiversity databases use. 

To make this file more compact and easier to read, we will first list the metadata for entities 
 that occurr more than once or which have to be described with more than one value. We will 
 then refer to them by their name or identifier when the activities are describeds.
