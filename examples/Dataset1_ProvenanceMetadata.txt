Explanation

Example provenance metadata file for Dataset 1, which is described in the document 
  https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/blob/main/docs/ProvenanceOfBiologicalMaterial_4paper.pdf
  This example uses the conceptual model (CM) of provenance presented there. 
  Please see that document to understand the context of these metadata.
Dataset 1 consists of logsheets in which data related to and collected during a 
 sampling event are recorded. This metadata file describes the provenance of that logsheet
 and the activities and people involved in the sampling event. 
This file is one of three examples we provide for Dataset 1: this is a plain text version, 
 written for humans rather than machines to read; a version in Turtle, which is written for
 machines; and a version using the EML metadata schema, which biodiversity databases use as their 
 catalogue metadata schema. 

To make this file more compact and easier to read, we will first list the metadata for objects  
 that occurr more than once in this record, or which have to be described with more than one value. 
 We will then refer to them by their name or identifier within the rest of the metadata.
