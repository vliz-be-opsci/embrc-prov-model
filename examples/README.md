# Examples

This folder provides examples demonstrating how the provenance model is applied, featuring four example datasets which are described in the [documentation](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/embrc-prov-model/tree/main/docs).


### Content: 
- **Plain text files**: Human-readable, providing a simplified overview of the dataset's provenance.  
- **EML files**: XML-formatted according to the schema widely used by biodiversity archives, designed for machine processing. *These examples are still to be created*
- **JSON-LD files**: RDF-formatted for machine processing, enabling semantic interoperability.
